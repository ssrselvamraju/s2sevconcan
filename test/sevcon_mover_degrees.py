%s, %s
This module writes a text file in a PCan driver accessible format to send CAN messages to the SEVCON motor to turn to particular angles. The module accepts angles in degrees and generates the appropriate HEX bytes for the move command. This program is a modification of the sevcon_mover.py which was originally designed to directly input the HEX bytes.The mapping of the degrees is not perfect currently, due to limited information available form SEVCON and will be corrected as the information required is obtained.
